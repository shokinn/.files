# ShokiNNs dotfiles

I manage my dotfiles using [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop).

## How to install

```shell
# git clone https://github.com/shokinn/.files ~/.files
# eval $(grep -v "^#" ~/.files/.env.public) ~/.files/dotdrop.sh
```

## Documentation

Maybe you should [take a look to my documentation](https://docs.pphg.tech/) to understand how I use my dotfiles.
